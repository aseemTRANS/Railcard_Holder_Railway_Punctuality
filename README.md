## Study 1: Railcard Holder

### Research Question
Does the occupation of an individual influence the likelihood of having a railcard for train
travel?

### Hypothesis Test
- Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant association between occupation and having a

### Research Question
Is there a statistically significant difference in the operator's punctuality before and after
covid-19?

### Hypothesis Test
- Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in the punctuality of operators
before and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a significant difference in the punctuality of operators before and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Result
- Study offers insightful information on covid-19 epidemic's impact on railway punctuality.
- The reduction in schedule trains and passangers during the pandemic highlightes complex interplay between external factors and transportation system performance.
